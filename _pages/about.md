Welcome to the world of Towfiq! This is me, Towfiqur Rashid, a student from Bangladesh and want to be a universal student 😊. I identify myself as a "research freak" with a deep-seated passion for uncovering data-driven solutions to complex urban challenges. My academic journey is defined by a delightful blend of spatial and statistical analyses, fueled by a desire to contribute to scientific advancements in a collaborative environment. I am a passionate transportation lover driven by an insatiable curiosity to know, learn, and grow more. Explore my portfolio!!
